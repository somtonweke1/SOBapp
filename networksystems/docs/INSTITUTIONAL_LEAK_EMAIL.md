Subject: OPERATIONAL AUDIT: Identified $[AMOUNT] Capital Leak at [DEPARTMENT NAME]

I am a pragmatic builder focused on Baltimore’s infrastructure efficiency. My terminal (SOBapp) has identified a systemic Operational Deadlock regarding your payments to [VENDOR NAME].

Findings:
- Fiscal Year Bleed: $[AMOUNT] in avoidable late fees and 9% statutory interest.
- Root Cause: 14-day lag between invoice receipt and payment reconciliation.

I have prepared a full Institutional Leak Analysis for your department. I am not looking for a relationship; I am offering a script-based abatement that eliminates this lag.

The Proposal: /ops/proposal

I am available for a 15-minute technical briefing at my Russell St. hub this week.

Result-oriented,
[Your Name] | SOBapp Forensics
