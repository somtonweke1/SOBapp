## Demo Flow

### Part 1: Hook - The Problem (3 minutes)

**Start Screen:** /supply-chain-risk landing page

**Opening:**
> "Constellation is planning 5GW of battery storage deployment by 2030. That requires approximately 50,000 tons of critical minerals - lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper. Here's the challenge..."

**Show the statistics (on landing page):**
- **68% of critical minerals flow through African supply chains** with political instability
- **60% of processing happens in China** - geopolitical dependency
- **300%+ price volatility** in 2021-2022
- **70% of cobalt from DRC alone** - single point of failure

**The Question:**
> "One disruption can delay your projects 6-12 months and cost $50M-$200M+. How do you de-risk this?"

**Transition:** "That's exactly what SOBapp solves. Let me show you."

---

### Part 2: Live Risk Dashboard (5 minutes)

**Navigate to:** /supply-chain-risk (scroll to risk dashboard section)

**Show:**
1. **Real-time risk scores** for each mineral:
   - Cobalt: 7.2/10 (HIGH) - "70% from DRC, political instability"
   - Lithium: 5.8/10 (MEDIUM) - "Water regulations in Chile"
   - Copper: 6.1/10 (MEDIUM) - "Infrastructure bottlenecks"
   - Rare Earths: 8.5/10 (CRITICAL) - "China export controls"

**Key Talking Points:**
> "These aren't just numbers. Each score represents real-time analysis of political stability, infrastructure capacity, production concentration, and market dynamics."

> "For Constellation's 5GW deployment, cobalt is your highest risk. You need 8,000 tons, and 70% comes from DRC. Let me show you what that means..."

**Click:** "Explore Full Intelligence Platform" button

---

### Part 3: Supply Chain Map Visualization (4 minutes)

**Navigate to:** Platform dashboard (/?access=platform) → "Supply Chain Risk" tab

**Show:** Critical Minerals Risk Map with network visualization

**Demonstrate:**
1. **Point to DRC mining operations:**
   > "This is where your cobalt comes from. Notice the network centrality - this is a chokepoint."

2. **Show Dar es Salaam port connection:**
   > "68% of DRC cobalt flows through this single port. Infrastructure delays here = project delays for you."

3. **Highlight alternative routes:**
   > "Our analysis identifies backup routes through Durban, South Africa. Costs $180/ton more, but reduces risk score from 7.2 to 4.8."

**Key Insight:**
> "We track 127 mining operations, 45 processing facilities, and 23 critical trade routes. You get visibility into every link in your supply chain."

---

### Part 4: Constellation Energy Risk Report (8 minutes)

**Navigate to:** /risk-report

**Walk Through:**

#### Executive Summary
> "This is a sample risk assessment for Constellation's 5GW battery storage project. Let's walk through what we found."

**Highlight:**
- Overall Risk: 6.5/10
- Financial Exposure: $180M
- 2 Critical Bottlenecks Identified
- 4 Cost Impact Scenarios

#### Mineral-by-Mineral Analysis
**Show the table:**
- Lithium: 12,500 tons, Risk 5.8
- Cobalt: 8,000 tons, Risk 7.2
- Nickel: 15,000 tons, Risk 4.5
- Copper: 22,000 tons, Risk 6.1

**Key Point:**
> "Notice cobalt - highest risk, smallest volume. But it's your critical path. No cobalt = no batteries = no project."

#### Supply Chain Bottlenecks
**Point to the two bottlenecks:**
1. **DRC → Dar es Salaam Port**
   > "70% dependency on single route. Political risk is HIGH. We recommend diversification to Zambian suppliers via Durban."

2. **Chinese Processing Dependency**
   > "60% of lithium processing happens in China. Geopolitical risk. Alternative: Australian processing adds 8 weeks but reduces risk 40%."

#### Cost Impact Scenarios
**Show the four scenarios:**
- Baseline: $2.8B
- Minor Disruption (+15% costs): $3.2B
- Major Disruption (+40% costs): $3.9B
- Critical Failure (6-month delay): $4.6B

**CFO Hook:**
> "A 6-month delay costs you $1.8B. Our intelligence service costs $100K annually. That's a 180x ROI if we help you avoid even one disruption."

#### Strategic Recommendations
**Walk through each recommendation:**
1. **Diversify cobalt sourcing** → "-2.5 risk points, $12M investment"
2. **Secure lithium supply contracts** → "Lock 18-month pricing at current $22,400/t"
3. **Develop alternative processing routes** → "Reduces China dependency from 60% to 35%"
4. **Implement buffer inventory strategy** → "45-day buffer for cobalt, 30-day for lithium"

**The Ask:**
> "Implementing all four recommendations requires $12M investment but reduces your overall risk from 6.5 to 4.2. More importantly, it virtually eliminates the $180M exposure scenario."

---

### Part 5: Weekly Intelligence Briefing (3 minutes)

**Navigate to:** /weekly-briefing-sample

**Show:**
> "This is what you'd receive every Monday at 9am - actionable intelligence for your team."

**Highlight:**
- **Critical Alerts:** "DRC cobalt corridor disruption - 18-25 day delays"
- **Risk Score Changes:** "Cobalt up 0.6 this week due to rail congestion"
- **Strategic Actions:** "Diversify sourcing NOW, initiate Zambian supplier conversations"

**Value Proposition:**
> "Your procurement team doesn't have time to monitor 127 mining operations across 8 countries. We do. Every Monday, you get the 3-5 things you need to act on that week."

---

## Objection Handling

### "We already have commodity price monitoring"
**Response:** "Price monitoring tells you what happened. We tell you what's about to happen - and what to do about it. Our value isn't in price data, it's in supply chain intelligence. We track infrastructure, politics, and network chokepoints that your price feeds don't capture."

### "Can't we just build this internally?"
**Response:** "You could. It took us 5 years of Johns Hopkins research to map 127 operations across 8 African countries. Plus ongoing relationships with mining operators, port authorities, and logistics providers. By the time you build it, you've already had your disruption. Question is: can you afford a $180M delay while you're building this capability?"

### "We have good relationships with our suppliers"
**Response:** "Great supplier relationships are critical. But what happens when the DRC government changes export taxes? Or when the port at Dar es Salaam floods? Your supplier can't control those risks. We help you identify them 3-6 months in advance and build contingency plans."

### "This seems expensive"
**Response:** "Let's put it in perspective. Tesla had a $180M impact from battery supply delays in 2022. BYD paid 40% premium for emergency cobalt sourcing in 2023. Our $25K annual service is 0.001% of your project budget but mitigates millions in downside risk. What's your cost of a 3-month delay?"

### "How accurate are your risk scores?"
**Response:** "Our scores are based on 15+ network centrality algorithms, real-time political stability data, infrastructure capacity analysis, and market dynamics. We don't predict earthquakes, but we accurately identify structural vulnerabilities in your supply chain. The DRC cobalt score of 7.2 reflects measurable chokepoints - 70% single-country dependency, 68% flowing through one port, political instability in Katanga province. These are facts, not predictions."

## Questions They'll Ask

**"How often is the data updated?"**
> "Risk scores update daily. Critical alerts are real-time. Weekly briefings every Monday at 9am EST. For Enterprise clients, we provide same-day alerts for critical disruptions."

**"Can we integrate this with our ERP/procurement systems?"**
> "Yes, Enterprise tier includes API access. We can push risk alerts directly into your systems, trigger workflow automations, or integrate with your supplier management platform."

**"What if we need analysis on minerals not covered?"**
> "Our platform covers lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, rare earths, and manganese - the critical battery minerals. If you need others (graphite, aluminum, etc.), we can add them to your custom assessments."

**"How do you source your data?"**
> "Three layers: (1) Public data from mining companies, port authorities, government agencies, (2) Real-time market data from commodity exchanges, (3) Proprietary network analysis from our Johns Hopkins research. We validate everything through multiple sources."

**"What makes your African supply chain intelligence unique?"**
> "We're based on 5+ years of Johns Hopkins research mapping African mining networks. We have relationships with operations in DRC, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, and Morocco. 68% of critical minerals originate in Africa - you can't de-risk your supply chain without understanding these networks."

**"Can we see a live demo for our specific projects?"**
> "Absolutely. That's what the $5K custom assessment delivers - a full risk analysis for your specific projects with your exact mineral requirements, sourcing strategy, and timeline. 2-week turnaround."

## Closing Lines

**For the close:**
> "Based on what we've discussed, I recommend we start with a $5,000 custom risk assessment focused on your highest-priority battery storage project. Two-week delivery. You'll get the exact same analysis we showed in the sample report, but tailored to your specific mineral requirements and sourcing strategy. If you find it valuable, we move to the Professional tier for continuous monitoring. Sound good?"

**If they need time:**
> "I understand. Let me send you access to the weekly risk briefing - completely free, no commitment. You'll start receiving intelligence next Monday. See the value firsthand. We can reconnect in two weeks to discuss next steps. Fair?"

**For the enthusiastic buyer:**
> "Great! Let's get started with the Professional tier. I'll send over the agreement today. You'll have full platform access within 24 hours, and we'll schedule your first monthly strategy call for next week. I'll also kick off your first custom assessment - what's your highest-priority project?"
