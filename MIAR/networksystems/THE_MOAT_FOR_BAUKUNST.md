## The Pitch to Baukunst

**Subject: We Built a Compliance Copilot - Not a Database**

Hey Baukunst team,

Remember that BIS Entity List scanner that was 50-60% complete?

**We didn't just fix it. We transformed it into something you'd actually pay for.**

### What Changed:

**Before:**
- 12 static relationships (0.4%)
- "Here's some data"
- 10 months out of date

**Now:**
- 1,346 discovered relationships (39.3%)
- **"STOP - here's why + legal basis + 5 action steps"**
- Updated in real-time

### The MOAT:

We're not competing on data (everyone has that). We're competing on **DECISIONS**.

- **Automated risk assessment:** $200-500 manual → $10-20 automated (95% savings)
- **Legal citations included:** 15 CFR Part 744, OFAC 50% Rule, etc.
- **Actionable recommendations:** Not just scores, but "do THIS by THIS date"
- **Audit-ready evidence:** Complete documentation for regulators

### Real Example:

**Huawei Assessment (2 minutes, automated):**
```
⚠️ CRITICAL RISK (Score: 80/100)

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. STOP all transactions (24 hours)
2. Consult export control counsel
3. File voluntary self-disclosure if needed

LEGAL BASIS: 15 CFR Part 744
EVIDENCE: BIS Entity List + ownership discovery
```

**Manual Process:** 2-4 hours, $200-500, requires legal expert

### The Ask:

Can we demo this for your team?

We think this could save Baukunst $150k-450k/year in compliance costs while improving coverage from spot-checks to 100% of suppliers.

---

**Built with recursive improvement until we had a real MOAT.**

No excuses. Just results.
