# Forensic Shield Project Log

**Status:** Pivot Complete. Platform is "Audit-Ready."

## Architecture Summary
- **The Gate:** `/claims` (formerly `/auth/signup`) is the new front-door.
- **The Contract:** Contingency agreement blocks `/audit` results until the 30% success fee is legally acknowledged.
- **The Weapon:** Abatement generator uses Baltimore-specific legal code (Water Accountability & Equity Act) for PDF/Text disputes.
- **The Ledger:** Dashboard tracks "Identified" vs "Recovered" capital with a JetBrains Mono "Forensic Font" for numerical precision.
- **The Network:** 3D Map pulses Amber for environmental risk based on historical dental/medical permit triggers.

## Immediate Deployment Checklist
1. `npm install` (adds QR code dependencies).
2. `npx prisma db push` (syncs `userRole` and `hasSignedAgreement`).
3. Verify the Harbor Bank strategic partner mention in the invoice footer.
